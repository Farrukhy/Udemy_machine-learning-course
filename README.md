# Machine Learning Projects

I have a background in machine learning with couple of Kaggle projects which mentioned in repositories. To solidify my knowledge and get certified, I'm restudying through a Udemy course by **Kirill Eremenko** and **Hadelin de Ponteves**. This repository documents my course journey, including projects and exercises.

## Course Details
- **Course Name**: Machine Learning A-Z™: Hands-On Python & R In Data Science
- **Instructors**: Kirill Eremenko (DS & AI Instructor) and Hadelin de Ponteves (Passionate AI Instructor)

## Progress
### Completed Modules:
- **Regression**
  
  [Upcoming: Classification, Clustering, Association Rule Learning, Reinforcement Learning, Natural Language Processing, Deep Learning, Dimensionality Reduction, Model Selection & Boosting]

## Projects

### Regression
#### Project 1: Predicting Energy Output
- **Description**: Applied regression techniques to predict energy output using ambient temperature, vacuum, ambient pressure, and humidity.
- **Methods**: Multiple Linear Regression, Polynomial Regression, Support Vector Regression (SVR), Decision Tree Regression, Random Forest Regression
- **Results**: Achieved a significant R² score, indicating a strong model performance.

### Kaggle Projects
#### Project 1: Disease Prediction
- **Dataset**: Kaggle Disease Prediction Dataset
- **Description**: Used various machine learning algorithms to predict diseases based on symptoms.
- **Methods**: Decision Trees, Random Forest, SVM
- **Results**: Achieved high accuracy in disease prediction using optimized models.

#### Project 2: Red Wine Quality Prediction
- **Dataset**: Kaggle Red Wine Quality Dataset
- **Description**: Predicted the quality of red wine based on physicochemical properties.
- **Methods**: Multiple Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest
- **Results**: Improved model accuracy through feature engineering and model tuning.

### Classification
*(To be added as the module is completed)*

## Key Learnings
